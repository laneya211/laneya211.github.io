  ABOUT HER:
  <div>
    I am 16 years old from New York City. Now entering junior year and aspiring to be a forensic pathologist and/or nurse.
    I come from an African American, West Indian, and Native American background so I was always told by my
    family to follow your dreams and never hold back because if you do you will never reach your full potential.
    As a child I always was interested in crime shows and could always solve a mystery using the few clues I could find.
    I also found a interest in cooking which I does with my mother. I enjoy all types of music but I love R&B including artists like H.E.R, Sza, and Maxwell
